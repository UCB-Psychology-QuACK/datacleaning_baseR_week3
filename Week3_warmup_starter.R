#### Group practice ####
# the goal is for you guys to work together to figure out some info about this dataset. 
# try to get all the info from R (ie. don't open the csv file in excel).
########################

#### 1.  Set your directory ####

# i. What is your current working directory?


# ii. Set your wd to the folder with the data and R script (if it isn't already the current wd)




#### 2. Load your data ####
# Load in penguin.csv


#### 3. Get some general info about the dataframe ####
# You can use any commands to get this info. Try to use R commands, don't just open up the dataframe and look. That said, feel free to look at the data frame and in the global environment to confirm the output of the R commands and your understanding.

# i. How many columns are there? 


# ii. What are the column names


# iii. How many rows?


# iv. What are the datatypes in this dataframe? 


# v. Are there any that would be better as factors? Change them!


# vi. What are a few other ways you can inspect your data without using R commands? Explain as many as you can think of.



#### 4. Learn more about each column ####

# i. Type a command to get descriptive stats (e.g., mean, median, sd) for each column


# ii. Do any columns have missing values (i.e., NAs)? If so, which ones and how many NAs in each column?


#### Challenge: Create a new column called cuteness.rating. Use what you learned last time to give them all a 10! ####
